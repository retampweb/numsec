# Numsec Rules

When the user types `/numsec "..."` in chat, treat it as a structured command.

## Required context
- Read `NUMSEC.md` first
- Then read:
  - `numsec/project.md`
  - relevant files under `numsec/threats/THREAT-*/threat.md`

## Change policy
- For non-trivial behavior/architecture changes, create a change proposal under `numsec/changes/<change-id>/` before implementation.

## Output expectations
- Respond with:
  - what you read
  - what you plan to do
  - what files you changed (if any)
